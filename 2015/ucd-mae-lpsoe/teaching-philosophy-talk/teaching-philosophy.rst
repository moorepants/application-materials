american socity of engineering education

Engineering is solving problems (chemistry teacher from UCD)
engineer is ultimately responible for creating something physical that solves a
percieved problem: bridge, computer, train

Organic evolution into an engineer (you speak a few words first and build)
speak the words you need to express your idea, if you can't express your idea
you learn new words

I'd like to have students try to "engineer" from day one. My ideal curriculum
would be defined around a large engineering problem that is broken up into
components

this is differen than provide tools, showing how to use tools, and seeing what
people come with, instead let the problems define the needed tools.

mechanical and aerospace engineering is a covers a broad range topics, we
should let students speciallize in what interests them the most

What engineer means to me

Little about me

what is the optimal learning path

Curriculum Design
-----------------

- Construct courses around central problems, so it is always clear why students
  are learning each bit.
- Develop course paths on what students may want to do
- Curriclum needs to be designed such that it can can. Ideally we have small
  incremental changes each year, and develop 5, 10 and 20 year plans. Updating
  them at each increment. Will allow curriculum to morph with the times in a
  more fluid fashion.
- Always allow experimental courses with more evaluation to test their
- Collect lots of data from students, profs, companies etc to jduge
- Make our curriculum decisions just like we make our engineering decisions

Courses take a long time to develop

Modularity down to the 30 min lessons can allow course materials to be merged.

Experience
----------

Teaching

- ENG 4 Fall 2013
- Tutorials
- SWC
- TA: ENG4, EME 150
- Machine Shop
- Bike Collective: ran ed non-profit
- Mentoring students: senior design, lab
- Numerous public speaking engagements

Mech Design

- NASA spec wind tunnel experimental apparti design
- Compressor design
- Biomedical device design
- Race cars, bicycles
- Appropriate tech for the developing world

Research

- graduate work on the human control of vehicles @ UCD
- post doctoral work on human control in walking @ CSU
- effects of realtime fuel econmony feedback on driver behavior
- optimal route planning for bicyclists
- utilization of mechanical human power

Teaching Methods
----------------

Engagement, activity, relevance, and feedback

- Modular lessons designed around ~10 minute concepts
- Each concept has at least a short student activity: q & a
- Feedback
- Connect lesson to real world
- Co-teaching
- Group work
- Project driven

Tech
----

- Utilize laptops and computing devices in the class
- Etherpad for each lesson where colloabortive  notes
- Wiki style developement of textbooks and examples
- Feedback mechanisms: sticky notes, 
- Massively collaborative lesson plan development that constantly updates

Training
--------

- Will be developing my teaching skills through training both at UC Davis and
  externally.
- Plan to work on our TA training. I'd like to work with the college to develop
  a TA training program.
- Offer teaching critiques to TAs and professors.
- IAMSTEM
- Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning
- TA group
- Puruse educational related grants

Accrediation
------------

I'm extremely organized and good at managing a large projec to prepare for the
6 year ABET accreds

I'm 

Diversity
---------

- Work with student leaders to develop inclusive spaces for minorities.
-
