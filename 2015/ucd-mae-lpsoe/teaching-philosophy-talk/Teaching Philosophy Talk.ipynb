After that, I got a MSC and PhD here where I focused on human control of vehicles. During graduate school I was fortunate to spend a year in the Netherlands at TU Delft under a Fulbright grant. I also co-founded and co-ran an educational non-profit here in Davis during graduate school. The city of Davis recognized my efforts there with an award in 2013.

There are many researchers, including those here in the education school, that study teaching methods in great detail.

For example, the book I show on the right should be read by every college instructor. It excellently provides seven principles for being a more effective teacher that are based on strong evidence.

    "These are some examples of evidence based methods I use in my classroom. First I limit my lecturing to 15 minutes per concept. Attention spans are generally only around 15 minutes. I break up these 15 minute sections with student activities, which can be a simple a multiple choice question or a longer group activity. I also make sure to use and share rubrics for grading. Students fill out self evaluations on for their exam performance to help them think critically about why their performance was the way it was and how to improve. For labs, in particular, I typically do \"hands off teaching\" and never do the student's action for them. This was important at the Davis Bike Collective because students generally need to do the action themselves to actually learn."

This course probably consumes half of their time the first year, essentially senior design during the freshman year. There is competition among teams and the instructors simply provide the necessary engineering concepts along the way as students need them. The problems teams face frame what concepts are learned. This experience lets students be engineers and understand what that really means early on in the curriculum. They create machines that many senior design courses would be pressed to top."

    "Besides my main points I want to cover couple more topics that are relevant. First, these are the courses in this department's undergraduate curriculum that I am ready to teach. I'm mostly \"dry\" mechanical engineer. My undergraduate, professional, and some graduate work were focused on mechanical design related topics. I then developed strong dynamics and controls skills here, at TU Delft, and my post doctoral work so I can cover these courses. Finally, I've have developed a strong suite software engineering, open source software development, and scientific computation and have been novices these skills a lot. I have a lot of ideas of how to give undergraduate students the fundamental skills need to be able to do things like app development, data analyses, and embedded control for their engineering projects. In fact I'd like to see computation increased in all typical mechanical engineering courses, as the world of data is already upon us.\n",

    "I've also taught ENG 4 here in the Fall 2013 and have that class developed to a base level. I've also been a TA for several of the bold courses over the years. I would love to be able to develop ENG 4 further."

    "The description for the position also indicates that a strong mechanical design background is needed. I want to mention several of my design experiences. I've designed full scale wind tunnel balances for NASA Langley, worked some in compressor design and manufacturing, designed several other experimental equipment. During my undergraduate years I participated in three different student design teams working on race cars, off road vehicles, and speed championship bicycles. I've done some design work for a Maglev train and finally I've worked with multiple groups in appropriate technology. In particular designing wheelchairs and human powered ambulances in Zambia and various other human powered machines in Guatemala."
