- good to tie in to the math 22b but don't spent a lot of time on it
- good to mention previous lecture
- unforced vibration: free vibration
- practice
- need to say that x=0 is the equilibrium position
- draw line to represent the equilibrium and then measure to the mass
- don't say "impose our will" it isn't relevant where it comes from
- don't write parantheses aound sin(wt)
- use the words free body diagram: if we drew a free body diagram...remember
  last time, force is new and in direction of the acceleration (make dots
  darker)
- use the whole board, be bigger font, big fonts and big equations
- say that you divide by m and make the ratios a constant, remember that from
  last time
- For a fixed omega_n there are three situations for c (therefore zeta) that
  have qualitatively different behavior: underdamped, overdamped, critically
- The solution is a function of time, that if I substitute it into this
  equation it satisfied it.
- linear equations: superposition so the sum of solutions is also a solution.
  So the particular solution is for a particular right hand side.
- A, B from Iinitial conditions
- spent a minute on the Python code that shows the solution
- i wrote a script that presents the frequency response, don't explain the code
- emphasize that there are two main parameters: how big is the particular
  soultion when I'm given omega_n and zeta
- emphasize the difference omega_n and omega
- use "natural frequency", omega is what the force has
- they only know about omega_n: the new thing is omega_n
- how this fucntion of omega affects things
- it is a function of omega over omega_n
- Omega is the absiccsa: the dependent variable, see how the amplitude varies
  as a function of the frequency the
- frequency ratio: make suer to say that, r=w/w_n
- wrote a script that lets us see this
- looke there is this enormous peak! but i can make the peak go up or down
  depending on zeta
- horizaontal axis is the frequency ratio
- vector diagram done expiditously
- E100: they see rotating phasors
- didn't draw omega on the rotating force diagram
- remember last time we show that the sum of the sin and cos as a phase shifted
- remember that omega is not omega_n: repeat that omega and omega_n is not the
  same thing: the ratio of the two is what is not important
- draw the frequency response showing r
- write code to plot this function
