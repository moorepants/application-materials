Description

The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) seeks candidates
for two Assistant Professor positions: one in the area of Multi-Body & System
Dynamics, and the other in Machine Design & Robotics. These are areas of broad
applicability and traditional strength within MAE.

Multi-Body & System Dynamics: The Department has long-standing research
strengths in multi-body & system dynamics, with applications to alternative
powertrain and vehicle dynamics, manufacturing automation, biomechanics, space
vehicle design, and autonomous/remotely-operated systems. The candidate is
expected to have a strong background in dynamics, systems design and analysis,
and controls as applied to one or more of these areas. The candidate is also
expected to teach courses in his or her areas of expertise, as well as
undergraduate and graduate courses including dynamics and systems design and
analysis. The new position is expected to extend and complement existing
efforts in these areas.

Mechanical Design & Robotics: Mechanical design and robotics are core areas of
research focus in the Department. These fields are concerned with the design
and integration of mechanical components with power sources, sensors and
actuators, and software to reliably accomplish complex tasks. Applications may
include (but are not limited to) design of machines and equipment, novel
manufacturing systems, field applications of robotics such as in automated
highway maintenance, robotic vehicles and autonomous systems, use of unmanned
aerial vehicles, and space applications of robotics. The candidate is expected
to have a strong background in mechanical design and robotics as applied to one
or more of these areas. The candidate is also expected to teach courses in his
or her areas or expertise, as well as undergraduate and graduate courses in
mechanical design and robotics. The new position is expected to extend and
complement existing efforts in these areas.
