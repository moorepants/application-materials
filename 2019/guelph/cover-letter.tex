\opening{Dear Search Committee:}

I am writing to apply for the ``Assistant or Associate Professor in Mechanical
Engineering'' position in the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences. I
am currently faculty in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at
the University of California, Davis. My official title is ``Lecturer with
Potential Security of Employment'' which is an academic senate tenure-track
position primarily focused on advancing undergraduate engineering education.

My goal is to transition into a research focused faculty position so that I can
further my work in augmented human mobility started in my graduate and
postdoctoral positions. The best fit for me is a university or college that has
a department who is mission focused, works together, and values continuous
change all while deeply valuing engineering education through teaching and
research mentorship.

I have included my research plan that centers around human mobility and a
teaching statement that outlines my pedagogical practices and how I think I
would fit into your department.

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
