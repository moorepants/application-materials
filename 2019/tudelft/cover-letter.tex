\opening{Dear Search Committee:}

I am writing to apply for the ``Assistant/Associate Professor (tenure track) in
Dynamics of Multibody systems'' in the department of biomechanical engineering
at TU Delft. I believe that I am highly qualified for your department's
advertised position.  For the last 15 years, I have developed unique research
expertise in the dynamics and control of bicycles as well as other topics that
align with your department's research areas. I have authored or co-authored
over 20 journal and conference articles on the subject of bicycles and my
doctoral work focused almost exclusively on the topic, resulting in a
dissertation entitled ``Human Control of a Bicycle'' which is well cited. I
have published X number of other papers, many of which where ancillary to the
bicycle dynamics and control research. These works and my active role in the
associated academic communities make me one of the handful of people in the
world with the expertise needed to take the TU Delft Bicycle Dynamics and
Control lab into the future.

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of California, Davis. My
position is an academic senate tenure-track position primarily focused on
advancing undergraduate engineering education. I spend approximately 70\% of my
time on teaching and learning, 20\% on professional achievements and
activities, and 10\% on academic and public service. I have been in this
position for over four years and my accomplishments over those years align
mostly with this position's teaching focus but I have also maintained a
research program centered on human mobility in transportation, sports, and
assistive technologies with much of the work advancing engineering in the
dynamics and control of bicycles. Prior to this position, I was a postdoctoral
researcher the field of human motion and control with applications in powered
lower limb exoskeletons and before that a graduate student with research in
bicycle dynamics, control and handling in a sport biomechanics lab. Through
these experiences I have developed strong applied computational and
experimental dynamics experience and have worked in several labs in a variety
of capacities.

My current research trajectory is focused on developing human-machine
synergistic controllers for powered exoskeletons, powered prostheses, and
personal mobility vehicles, particularly single track vehicles. These assistive
devices will play a significant role in how the abled and disabled get around
in the future.

I have a strong record of obtaining competitive funding even though it is not a
requirement for my current position. As a graduate student, I initiated and
co-authored an awarded US National Science Foundation grant to study the
control of bicycles. This effort was unique given both the student initiative
and the fact that we were able to make the case for obtaining resources for a
research area that is often more challenging to fund. As a student, I was also
awarded a very selective Fulbright Scholarship to the Netherlands, where I
spent a productive year in the bicycle dynamics lab at TU Delft. Most recently,
I was co-PI on a successful \$5 million grant from the US Department of
Education, as well as several internal grants for education activities over the
last four years.

My extensive teaching record in dynamics and design includes courses in the
topics of mechanical design, mechanical vibrations, system dynamics, multibody
dynamics, and vehicle dynamics at the undergraduate (BSc) and graduate (MSc,
PhD) levels. I make use of many education research backed practices in my
teaching and I am constantly improving the courses based on this research. I
have taught courses up to 120 students and managed up to four teaching
assistants per class.

I have mentored close to 500 BSc and MSc students in over 100 engineering
projects in the last four years.  As these projects involved external project
sponsors I developed relationships with a diverse set of research, non-profit,
and industry organizations.  Several of these projects are also with
international groups in Kenya, Nicaragua, Cambodia, and Sweden. I am especially
proud of the exchange program I have developed with Meijo University in Japan.
My native language is English and will be able to teach MSc classes immediately
at TU Delft, but I have a beginner understanding of Dutch and am eager to
become fluent so I can teach BSc courses.

Lastly, I have a strong service record. I serve on my department's
undergraduate curriculum committee where we are modernizing our course
offerings. I serve on the scientific and planning committees of the Bicycle and
Motorcycle Dynamics conference series and recently hosted the International
Cycling Safety Conference at UC Davis for the first offering outside of Europe.

The best career fit for me is to be a faculty member at a university department
that is mission focused, works together forwarding this common mission, and
values continuous change all while deeply valuing engineering education through
teaching and research mentorship.

% TODO : Add some sentences saying how I'd work with people, students, and
% companies there.

I have included my research plan that centers around human mobility and a
teaching statement that outlines my pedagogical practices in addition to how I
think I would fit into your department.

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
