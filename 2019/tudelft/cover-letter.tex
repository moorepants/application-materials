\opening{Dear Search Committee:}

I am writing to apply for the ``Assistant/Associate Professor (tenure track) in
Dynamics of Multibody systems'' in the department of biomechanical engineering
at TU Delft. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of
California, Davis. My position is an academic senate tenure-track position
primarily focused on advancing undergraduate engineering education. I spend
approximately 70\% of my time on teaching and learning, 20\% on professional
achievements and activities, and 10\% on academic and public service. I have
been in this position for over four years and my accomplishments over those
years align mostly with this position's teaching focus but I have also
maintained a research program centered on human mobility in transportation,
sports, and assistive technologies with much of the work advancing engineering
in the dynamics and control of bicycles. Prior to this position I was a
postdoctoral researcher the field of human motion and control with applications
in powered lower limb prostheses and before that a graduate student with
research in bicycle dynamics, control and handling in a sport biomechanics lab.

I believe that I am highly qualified for your department's advertised position.
For the last 15 years, I have developed unique research expertise in the
dynamics and control of bicycles as well as other topics that align with your
department's research lines. I have authored or co-authored over 20 journal and
conference articles on the subject of bicycles and my doctoral work focused
almost exclusively on the topic, resulting in a dissertation entitled ``Human
Control of a Bicycle'' which is well cited. I have published X number of other
papers, many of which where ancillary to the bicycle dynamics and control
research. These works and my active role in the associated academic communities
make me one of the handful of people in the world with the expertise needed to
take the TU Delft Bicycle Dynamics and Control lab into the future.

I have a strong record of obtaining competitive funding even though it is not a
requirement for my current position. As a graduate student, I initiated and
co-authored an awarded US National Science Foundation grant to study the
control of bicycles which was unique in both from the student initiative and
making the case to fund an oft-harder to fund topic. As a student, I was also
awarded a very selective Fulbright Scholarship to the Netherlands, where I
spent a productive year in the bicycle dynamics lab. Most recently, I was co-PI
on a successful \$5M grant from the US Department of Education, as well as
several internal grants for education activities over the last four years.

I have an extensive teaching record in dynamics and design. I have taught
courses in the topics of mechanical design, mechanical vibrations, system
dynamics, multibody dynamics, and vehicle dynamics at the undergraduate (BSc)
and graduate (MSc, PhD) levels. I have mentored close to 500 BSc and MSc
students in over 100 engineering projects in the last four years that were all
partnered with research, non-profit, and industry organizations. Several of
these projects are with international groups in Kenya, Nicaragua, Cambodia, and
Sweden. I am especially proud of the exchange program I have developed with
Meijo University in Japan. My native language is English and will be able to
teach MSc classes immediately at TU Delft. I have a beginner understanding of
Dutch and am eager to become fluent so I can teach BSc courses.

The best fit for me is at a university has a department who is mission focused,
works together forwarding this common mission, and values continuous change all
while deeply valuing engineering education through teaching and research
mentorship.

My current research trajectory is focused on developing human-machine
synergistic controllers for powered exoskeletons, powered prostheses, and
human-scale mobility vehicles, particularly single track vehicles. These
assistive devices will play a significant role in how the abled and disabled
get around in the future.

I have included my research plan that centers around human mobility and a
teaching statement that outlines my pedagogical practices in addition to how I
think I would fit into your department.

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
