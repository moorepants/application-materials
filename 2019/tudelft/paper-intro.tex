\maketitle

I have attached three sample papers that demonstrate my research and writing.
The first paper is my highest cited first author journal article that was
published in Multibody System Dynamics as a graduate student~\cite{Moore2011c}.
The second paper is another first author paper published in
PeerJ~\cite{Moore2015b} during my postdoc. And the third paper is a preprint of
my lab's most recent work in which I mentored the student authors and was the
primary author of the text. It has been accepted for publication in PLOS
ONE~\cite{Cloud2019b}.
