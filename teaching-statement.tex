%\maketitle

My interest in mechanical engineering began in my childhood where I spent many
hours making, tinkering, and discovering how the built environment functioned.
These hands-on experiences allowed me to develop a desire to discover the
connection to mathematics and physics in order to improve my projects. Once
that realization occurred, any barriers I had towards learning the engineering
fundamentals were lifted. I hope to bring similar kinds of experiences and
motivation to the students I teach.

\section*{Teaching Philosophy}
%
Traditional engineering pedagogy typically focuses heavily on lecture-based
theoretical courses paired with some hands-on laboratory courses. The aspects
of creativity, team collaboration, and an infinite possibility of problem
solutions are all too often absent. These aspects are needed to develop the
practical side of engineering that they will require in their future careers.
Cookbook instructions for lab experiments or canned problems with a single
solution are virtually never present in the real world.  Often, only the
students who participate in extracurricular projects, internships, or research
positions make the connection from theory to practice early on in the
curriculum. Thus, the traditional structure may not be the best way to maximize
student understanding of core engineering principles and instill the agile
problem solving methods they will need in the future.

Although there are variety of motivational reasons students pursue engineering,
I believe introducing the applied practices of engineering early in education
will build passion and interest. Once this door is open, it is much easier to
weave in the skills the students need to become stronger engineers in their
future careers. I would like to see an engineering curriculum that mimics the
actual practice of engineering through an iterative pattern of posing realistic
problems followed by a search for the necessary fundamentals which culminates
in the application of new knowledge to arrive at a solution to the problem.
Like my childhood experience, this model allows interesting realistic problems
that allow students to discover the engineering fundamentals as opposed to
presenting all of the fundamentals before the interesting problems arrive.

Engineering students are capable of creating and solving problems when they
enter college. We should enrich their entire experience (especially in the first
year!) with challenges from real-world problems that leave them begging for the
knowledge and tools that they typically have to slog through during their first
years of school. Richard Miller, President of Olin College, often draws an
analogy between engineering students and violin students: ``Can you imagine not
playing the violin until your fourth year of study? Violinists start making
sounds with their instrument the first day of lessons.'' Our curriculum could
allow our students to draw the engineering bow across the strings the minute
they step into the classroom. For these early project-based courses to be
effective, however, the latest pedagogical developments must be utilized to
maximize learning potential.

\section*{Practical Classroom Examples}
%
In my courses, I try to provide students with open-ended problems that
culminate in larger projects instead of problems designed for rote learning and
traditional exams. This approach more closely mimics the practice of
engineering. I combine this with rubric based assessments that set the bar for
mastery for better student outcomes and effective assessment. I attempt to have
a good mixture of group and individual work, leaning more heavily toward the
former so students are prepared for the needs of industry. I also have been
working to orient my classrooms towards active learning. My best example is the
utilization of ``computational thinking'' that focuses on live coding in class.
I have setup a JupyterHub server that students log into via laptops, tablets,
and phones during class that provides an interactive engineering computational
environment. This also serves my Jupyter Notebook based interactive textbook
that students use as a reading guide while I provide examples paired with short
computing exercises to assess learning multiple times during class. I have
developed a workshop for other practitioners to use these methods with my
colleague Allen Downey at Olin College of Engineering and have been asked to
speak on the subject multiple times in the past couple of years. Lastly,
another very important method that I make use of is rapid in-class assessment;
at every break, each student provides me with anonymous quick feedback: one
line comments that share what they didn't understand and what was effective.
This allows me to adjust my teaching after the break based on the feedback. I
tie this in with collected feedback before, during, and after the course to
have data to back my teaching decisions.

All of these methods are backed by evidence from education research. To keep
up-to-date on topics like these, I follow the education research literature,
especially the summary literature aimed at practicing educators and attend
``teach the teachers'' style workshops as much as possible. I have worked
closely with the Center for Educational Effectiveness and the Engineering
Education Learning Community these past three years to improve student
learning in my courses.

\section*{Prior Experience and Future Interests}
%
A teacher is often at their best when they know their material well. I was
fortunate to have spent most of my graduate school years in the UCD MAE
department and now three years on the faculty making me intimately familiar
with the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. I have taught a number of the
available courses as a teaching assistant, lecturer, and professor. At the
undergraduate level I have strong experience with mechanics and machine design
courses along with the dynamics and controls curriculum. I have taught ENG 004,
EME 050, ENG 122, EME150A, EME 150B, EME185A, EME185B, MAE 223, MAE 297 and
will add EME 134 and EME 171 to the list this coming year. In my capacity as a
teaching oriented professor I have worked on introducing evidence based
practices and innovations in the classroom. Some highlights from the last three
years are:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
  \item developed a design competition and exchange program with Meijo
    University (Nagoya, Japan) on the cultural influences of robot and machine
    design
  \item flipped a mechanical vibrations class by utilizing ``computational
    thinking'' and project oriented learning with a custom designed interactive
    textbook and deployment through a JupyterHub server
  \item created a design studio classroom space that facilities active learning
    for our design courses
  \item created extensive rubric based assessment for written and oral
    communication in the capstone design course
  \item created a set of twenty jupyter notebooks on multibody dynamics for
    in-class use and accompanying publicly available videos
  \item developed a transit bus bicycle rack design project which included
    reverse engineering, concept generation, and lightweight prototyping
  \item solicitation and mentoring of over 70 industry, government, and
    non-profit supported design projects spanning the mechanical engineering
    displine
\end{itemize}

There are at least three new undergraduate courses that I would like to
co-develop in the future that will help modernize our curriculum and are
influenced by my research endeavors: 1) a first year problem solving with data,
simulation and engineering computation, 2) an upper level applied robotics and
controls course, and 3) an upper level elective in focusing on project based
prosthesis design.

At the graduate level, I am also well prepared to teach many MAE courses in
dynamics, control theory, biomechanics, and vehicle dynamics. I have taught
Multibody Dynamics and would like to continue to do so but with an aim to
modernize it with the latest developments in fundamental multibody algorithms
and computational dynamics. I would also like to develop a graduate course
focusing on the design, simulation, and optimization of legged biomechatronics
that aligned closely with my research.  Students will learn about neuromuscular
modeling, mammalian gait, and get exposed to the latest tools in the field
(OpenSim, Biomechancal ToolKit, IPOPT, etc). An experimental biomechanics
oriented course will also nicely complement the computational oriented one to
prepare students for applied work in the field.

My course topic strengths are not entirely based on current UCD MAE offerings.
I have spent time at Delft University of Technology, Old Dominion University,
Cleveland State University, Stanford University, and with the Software
Carpentry non-profit where I have gleaned both new course ideas and
methodologies to provide stronger connections to industry. I have experience in
teaching computational methods for data science. I have given numerous
workshops and tutorials to scientists and engineers on simulation,
optimization, and data analysis. I have been trained by the Software Carpentry
organization in pedagogical methods and teach two-day workshops around the
world to introduce scientists and engineers to the best practices and methods
in scientific computing. The mechanical engineer of the future will be
additionally tasked with data driven engineering. The engineering curriculum
will need to adapt to bring data science into many of the core courses for our
students to stay competitive in the job market.
